# database-qa

A simple Streamlit app that lets you ask questions to your SQL database and get answers in natural language. Built using LangChain and Google Gemini for LLM-powered SQL querying.

## Features
- Ask natural language questions about your database and get readable answers.
- Few-shot examples to guide the model for more accurate answers.
- Connects to any MySQL database.
- Returns clear, readable answers even if the SQL result is empty.

## Files
- main.py – Streamlit interface for entering questions and displaying answers.
- langchain_helper.py – Sets up the LangChain SQLDatabaseChain with a Google Gemini model, embeddings, and few-shot prompts.
- few_shots.py – Provides example question/SQL/answer pairs to guide the model.

## Installation
1. Clone the repo:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/database-qa.git
cd database-qa

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

3. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Create a .env file and add your Google API key:
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

5. Make sure your MySQL database is running and accessible. Update credentials in langchain_helper.py if needed.

## Usage
Run the Streamlit app:
streamlit run main.py

- Enter your question in the input box.
- The app will generate the SQL query, run it on your database, and return a clear natural language answer.

## Notes
- The app uses few-shot learning to improve SQL query generation. Adding more examples in few_shots.py can make answers more accurate.
- Works with any MySQL database; just update the connection string in langchain_helper.py.
- .env is used to keep API keys private. Make sure .env is in .gitignore.
- __pycache__ is automatically generated by Python and should be ignored in Git.

## Example Questions
- How many records meet certain criteria?
- What is the total value of a column for certain rows?
- How much will be generated if specific conditions are applied?
